#+TITLE: =virtual-dom=

This library provides Haskell (GHCJS) bindings to the [[https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom][virtual-dom]] project. virtual-dom is a set of Javascript libraries to allow one to build a functional representation of the browser DOM in a declarative manner, and efficiently render these changes into the DOM.

These bindings provide:

- A [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens][lens]] interface to building elements and setting their attributes.
- A [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lucid][lucid]]-like DSL for building HTML documents - with functions for all HTML 5 elements and attributes.
- The ability to register [[https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom/blob/master/docs/hooks.md][hooks]].
- The ability to attach event handlers by using [[https://github.com/Raynos/dom-delegator][dom-delegator]].

For a small example of how this library can be used, see below

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import VirtualDom

main :: IO ()
main =
  do body <- bodyContainer
     initDomDelegator
     renderTo body
              (with body_
                    (on "click" (const (putStrLn "Ouch")))
                    [into h1_ ["Heading"]])
